        <p class="main-text">
          I have found it difficult to summarize all my experiences at CMU into
          one page. This version of my resume focuses on my leadership and
          extracurricular experiences. Programming projects can be found under

        <h2>Overview, "Advice", and Lecture Notes</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Although I did graduate with a dual degree in the end, I made a couple
          of missteps along the way from which I wish others can learn. This
          might be relevant if you're trying to do computational finance and
          computer science as well.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          Most BSCF majors take the core sequence 21-270, 21-370, and 21-420 in
          their freshman and sophomore years (like I did). In my opinion this
          unnecessarily front-heavy schedule prevents one from fully
          appreciating the deep ideas of risk-neutral pricing, backward
          induction, and stochastic calculus. Stochastic calculus (Brownian
          motion, Ito integrals, Change of measure...) is especially
          mind-boggling without some understanding of Riemannian analysis (not
          to mention Lebesgue and measure theory, which is what probability and
          hence math finance are all about). However, because most people join
          the BSCF program during their sophomore fall semester, one may fear
          that they are losing out if they haven't taken 21-270 and 21-370 by
          their sophomore fall. Indeed, it is impossible to be accepted for BSCF
          without taking 21-270, but one can also apply in their sophomore
          spring semester (or even later!).
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          So what is one to do? One option is to front-load the other necessary
          math classes as well. Ideally, 21-355 (Real I) should be taken before
          21-420, so probably sophomore fall is a good time (the prospect of
          taking Real Analysis as a freshman is extremely daunting). 21-325
          (Probability) and 21-260 (Differential Equations) are prerequisites
          for 21-420, so there is no getting around them either. If one also
          wants a CS major/ degree, they must also keep up with the CS core
          classes. So that's about 10-12 technical classes in the first three
          semesters. Not impossible, but certainly challenging.
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
          The other option is to defer 21-270 to sophomore spring, and then take
          21-370 and 21-420 during one's junior year. This allows one to
          comfortably clear the math prerequisites and even take a few
          interesting math classes (e.g. 21-301, 21-373, other 21-3xx or 21-4xx
          classes) during the first two years. Particularly capable math majors
          can consider finishing both undergraduate Real Analysis classes
          (21-355, 21-356) in their sophomore years. Then they can venture
          further with the graduate classes 21-720 (Measure and Integration) and
          21-721 (Graduate Probability). By then, most of the intellectual
          nuance and beauty of 21-420 should be apparent. Alas, I never got as
          far as 21-7xx myself, but many other undergraduates have. The primary
          reason for that is that the BSCF and CS program all demand attention
          to other core classes, hindering my pursuit of pure math (I only had
          time for that in junior year, a pity). Which is why it might be
          advisable even to aim for a pure math rather than BSCF major. It's
          frankly more work, but employers recognize and appreciate that. Most
          BSCF graduates enter the sell-side; buy-side and prop shops mostly
          hire pure math and/or MS graduates.

          By the way, if you're interested in some handwritten lecture notes of
          math classes, you can find them

            here</a
          >. I was not the best math student, but the algebra and analysis
          classes represented were some of the most stimulating and rewarding I
          have taken at CMU. Knowing why there's a quadratic formula and
          extensions to the cubic and quartic cases, but no general formula for
          quintic equations is one of the most exhilarating things I have
          experienced in school. Essentially, some of the roots to

          >, and many others, are hidden so far within the depths of the complex
          plane that no number of elementary numerical operations and square
          roots can get you there. There is simply no way to write them out
          exactly.

        <h3><a id="251 tutor" class="header">15-251 Tutor</a></h3>
        <p class="description">
          15-251 is the introductory course in Theoretical Computer Science at
          CMU. It introduces concepts such as Turing Machines, Decidability,
          Graph Theory, P vs NP, and Cryptography. As a tutor, I met 1-on-1 with
          a student every week to review that week's content and reinforce his
          understanding of the key concepts.
        </p>
        <h3><a id="treasurer" class="header">SSA Treasurer</a></h3>
        <p class="description">
          As the treasurer of the Singapore Students Association, I took full
          responsibility of the organization's finances. A large part of my work
          was formulating a $6,000+ annual budget and overseeing its
          disbursement throughout the year. We organized team-building
          activities, celebrated local festivals, and promoted Singaporean
          culture to the wider community.

        <h3><a id="moneythink" class="header">Moneythink Mentor</a></h3>
        <p class="description">
          During my stint at Moneythink CMU as Mentor Captain, I conducted
          weekly 1-hour mentorships in different Pittsburgh-area High Schools on
          financial management. We regularly delivered Powerpoint presentations
          and shared academic materials. Topics covered include Savings, Credit
          Cards, Loans, Taxes, Investment, College Admissions, and Insurance.
        </p>
        <h3><a id="UCC" class="header">Consulting Club</a></h3>
        <p class="description">
          I served as a Pro-Bono Lead in 2019 at CMU's Undergraduate Consulting
          Club, participating in 2 pro-bono consulting projects. We liaised with
          a multinational Healthcare startup for an ongoing project on Indian
          and U.S. market research. Previously, we also aided a Pittsburgh-based
          educational non-profit’s sponsor acquisition efforts in 2018-19 by
          evaluating potential partners and creating a long-term framework for
          sponsorship retention.

          <a id="tef" class="header">Technical Enhanced Facilities Operator</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
          As a TEF Operator, I performed Level 1 technical support to resolve
          software issues faced by users of Carnegie Mellon’s Windows-, Mac- and
          Linux-based computing terminals for 8+ hours per week during term
          time.
        </p>
        <h3><a id="rowing" class="header">Rowing</a></h3>
        <p class="description">
          I was part of CMU's Club Rowing team during my first Fall semester.
          The sport taught me much about grit, team chemistry, and coordination,
          and I enjoyed watching my blade graze the calm waters. Unfortunately,
          I decided to quit due to physical exhaustion and busier subsequent
          semesters.
