          After hopping from college to college, I decided on the CF/CS track
          because I saw the immense value in being able to
          <em>compute</em>
          something. Thanks to the dedication and passion of Carnegie Mellon's
          amazing professors, I am privileged to have caught a glimpse of the
          wondrous potential of math and technology during my four years there.
          As a Math Major, I enjoy the

          of Algebra and Analysis, especially their applications to
          cryptography, math finance, and beyond. On the tech side, my interests
          span Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, Databases, and Web
          Development.

          Outside of work, my greatest passion is exploring different places and
          cultures, be they nearby neighborhoods or distant countries. When
          physical travel is not possible (for instance, during the ongoing
          coronavirus pandemic), film, music, and literature have provided
          invaluable respite. Complementing that, I like learning languages to
          better understand cultures. Owing to my immigrant upbringing, I am a
          native speaker of English and Mandarin Chinese. French is my best
          "foreign" language, but I have also picked up bits and pieces of
          German, Spanish, Shanghainese, and Cantonese from travelling and
          self-study. If you're at CMU and want to know more about languages, I
          strongly recommend

        <p class="main-text">
          Think of this website, in its current state, as a snapshot. There are
          discussions of my academic involvement, projects, and travels
          throughout my time at CMU. If you can read Chinese, I also have a
          small page with some of my Chinese writings from a long time ago. Most
          importantly, enjoy your time here and live your best life.
