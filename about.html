          After hopping from college to college, I decided on the CF/CS track
          because I saw the immense value in being able to
          <em>compute</em>
          something. I'm privileged to have studied under dedicated and
          knowledgeable professors, whose expertise illuminated the limitless
          potential of math and technology to solve the world's problems. As a
          Math Major, I enjoy the

          of Algebra and Analysis, especially their applications to
          cryptography, math finance, and beyond. On the tech side, my interests
          span Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, Databases, and Web
          Development. By leveraging large-scale systems and innovative
          algorithms, I believe that value can be unlocked for individuals and
          firms alike.

          Outside of work, my greatest passion is exploring different places and
          cultures, be they nearby neighborhoods or distant countries. When
          physical travel is not possible (for instance, during the ongoing
          coronavirus pandemic), film, music, and literature have provided
          invaluable respite. Complementing that, I like learning languages to
          better understand cultures. Owing to my immigrant upbringing, I am a
          native speaker of English and Mandarin Chinese. While French is my
          best "foreign" language, I have also picked up bits and pieces of
          German, Spanish, Shanghainese, and Cantonese from travelling and
          self-study. If you're at CMU and want to know more about languages, I
          strongly recommend

        <h2>What I Hope to Do Here</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          My overarching goal for this website is to present to the reader what
          I find meaningful about my life. I have included sections discussing
          my academic involvement, projects, and travels throughout my time at
          CMU. If you can read Chinese, I also have a small page with some of my
          Chinese writings from a long time ago. While I am not likely to update
          this website regularly anymore, I hope that visitors, especially
          undergrduates or those from CMU, will find something worth reading
          here.
