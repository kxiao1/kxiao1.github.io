          After hopping among several colleges, I decided on the CF/CS track
          because I saw the immense value in being able to
          <em>compute</em>
          something. I'm privileged to have studied under dedicated and
          knowledgeable professors, whose expertise illuminated the limitless
          potential of math and technology to solve the world's problems. As a
          Math Major, I enjoy the

          in Algebra and Analysis, especially their applications to
          cryptography, math finance, and beyond. On the tech side, my interests
          span Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, Databases, and Web
          Development. By leveraging large-scale systems and innovative
          algorithms, I believe that value can be unlocked for individuals and
          firms alike.

          Outside of work, my greatest passion is exploring different places and
          cultures, whether it's nearby neighborhoods or distant countries. When
          physical travel is not possible (for instance, during the ongoing
          coronavirus pandemic), film, music, and literature have provided
          invaluable respite. Complementing that, I am also an avid learner of
          foreign languages, which have connected me with foreign cultures.
          Owing to my immigrant upbringing, I speak English and Mandarin Chinese
          with a native proficiency. While French is my best "foreign language",
          I have also picked up bits and pieces of German, Spanish,
          Shanghainese, and Cantonese from travelling and self-study. If you're
          at CMU and want to know more about languages, I strongly recommend

        <h2>What I Hope to Do Here</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          My overarching goal for this website is to present to the reader what
          I find meaningful about my life. Depending on who the reader is,
          he/she might find different aspects of this website's content worth
          reading. I have included sections discussing my academic involvement,
          projects, and travels. If you can read Chinese, I also have a small
          page where I post some of my Chinese writings. As time permits, I hope
          to reguarly update this website.
