# Landing Page on Andrew Servers

When a user tries to access http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~kzx/ or https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kzx/, they will be redirected to the [domain](https://kxiao.net) of the Github Pages website.

CMU's Computing Club will automatically [host](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/) in their Apache Server files placed under a directory named www in your AFS home directory. Computing Services does [a similar thing](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/server/publish.html) but requires a click of the 'Publish' button.
