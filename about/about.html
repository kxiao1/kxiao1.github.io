                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="main-text">                    My name is <strong>Karl Xiao</strong> (<span style="font-family: Noto Sans CJK SC, SimSun;font-weight: 200">肖泽天/萧澤天</span>), and I am a Sophomore studying Computational Finance and Computer Science at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>. I was born in Shanghai, China and raised in Singapore, coming to the United States after completing my mandatory military service there.

                    A big reason why I stumbled upon the CF/CS track was the quality of instruction in technical courses like those at CMU. My professors, armed with complete mastery in their areas of expertise, painstakingly demonstrated what it truly meant to <em>compute</em>  something (which is why both of my Majors have that word in it). During my Freshman Summer, I did research in Mathematical Finance on the pricing of perpetual options, and my group used both mathematical proofs and numerical approximation for corroboration. Now in my Sophomore year, I am taking more advanced classes that will incorporate a slew of probabilistic and calculus-based techniques which I hope will help refine our earlier research. I am also excited to serve as a Course Tutor for <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/" target="_blank">15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science</a>, a primer for the study of computation, in Spring 2020.

                    Outside of work, my greatest passion is exploring different places and cultures, whether it's nearby neighborhoods or distant countries. Naturally, I am also an avid learner of foreign languages, which helps me better engage with the locals wherever I go. Owing to my upbringing, I speak English and Mandarin Chinese with a native proficiency. French is currently my best "foreign language", but I also speak/ understand bits and pieces of German, Spanish, Shanghainese, and Cantonese due to travel and cultural exposure. My favorite non-technical class thus far at CMU is, unsurprisingly, <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=80-180" target="_blank">80-180 Nature of Language </a>.

                <h2>What I Hope to Do Here</h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    My chief and overarching purpose for this website is to present to the reader what I find meaningful about my life. Depending on who you are, you might find different aspects of this website's content meaningful. I have included sections discussing my academic involvement, research and travels. As time permits, I hope to add more stuff in time to come.
