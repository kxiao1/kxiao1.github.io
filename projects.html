        <h2>2D Chess (Winter 2020)</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Inspired by the Netflix show The Queen's Gambit, I decided to study in
          a bit more detail some of the most celebrated chess games in history,
          such as the Opera Game and Fischer's Game of the Century.
          Unfortunately, I do not possess Beth's ability to visualize chess
          games on the ceiling. Therefore, I built a offline simulator that
          allows the player to explore, in theory, every single legal game. With
          move highlighting, the ability to undo, restart, or resign, as well as
          the outputing of game logs with algebraic notation, this desktop app
          is ideal for practicing chess. The program was developed in Java
          (using the JavaFX library), and built with Maven. The complete code
          can be found

        <h2>Todo-Logs (Winter 2020)</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Due to COVID-19, Winter Break lasted longer than usual, and I would
          pass many days not knowing what I had accomplished in the past 24
          hours. Therefore, I decided to build my own full-stack To-Do app with
          ReactJS and Django to remedy this existential crisis. The frontend is
          hosted
          <a

          version of the app by following the instructions in my

        <h2>Visual Question Answering (Fall 2020)</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Imagine that you are visually impaired and can't really discern the
          expiry date of your bread, or more annoyingly the card number on your
          new credit card. Over the past few years, large strides have been made
          in Visual Question Answering (VQA) such that a blind person can take a
          picture of their surroundings, ask a question, upload them, and have a
          machine analyze the image for an apposite answer. This task
          nonetheless remains difficult because we must deal with poor-quality
          images and often inconsistent human-annotated training examples. In
          this project, we built upon a successful Attention-based CNN baseline
          using image augmentation, feature identification, and a refined
          attention model. Our best-performing model improved accuracy by 3.9%
          relative to the baseline.

            >Labs@SEA</a
          >, I was tasked with implementing a simple gif-fetching webapp using
          Javascript libraries. This personal project served to familiarize me
          with ReactJS and hone my frontend development skills. It goes without
          saying that I put in way more effort on that small ReactJS app than I
          did for this static website. I opted to model my app after Instagram,
          so you see three columns of results, heart shapes etc. I still had
          several design choices to make, such as how quickly the search results
          changed as you typed. Note that the original project specification
          mandated a Google OAuth feature, which I have preserved for sake of
          completeness. However, there is no server or localstorage to store
          personal information. You can view the app

        <h2>Forex Options Research Project (Summer 2019)</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          We conducted an interesting study of FOREX options in perpetual time.
          With finite-time American call options, for instance, one will not
          exercise them early when the prevailing domestic interest rate \(r_d\)
          is positive. But in the FOREX case, a delay in exercising means losing
          out on the foreign currency's interest rate \(r_f\). Suppose further
          that one is given unlimited time to make up his mind. How then to
          proceed? We determine criteria for optimally exercising perpetual
          FOREX options - this exercise threshold would be some "stock price"
          (to be precise, some exchange rate) and we can plot the option's price
          \(V(S)\) against the underlying price. Complementing the stationary
          Black-Scholes ODE \[\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{d^2V}{d^2S} + (r_d -
          r_f) S \frac{dV}{dS} - r_d V(s) = 0\] with extensive numerical
          simulation, we obtained various results which can be seen as
          generalizations of their finite, long-maturity corollaries. Please

        <h2>Stock Market Tracking (Summer 2018)</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          Before coming to CMU, I built an Excel Spreadsheet that could provide
          real-time alerts to price fluctuations, similar to the push
          notifications that Robinhood sends to your phone. The main difference
          is that with Robinhood, you see the price movement but you cannot
          manipulate the data, for instance put it in a chart or record it in a
          specific table. My spreadsheet uses Excel's
          <em>Get and Transform</em> Tool (previously known as
          <em>Power Query</em>) to periodically grab tables of data from a
          Google Sheet. Upon every refresh, the Google Sheet contained
          up-to-date information thanks to Google Finance. Lastly, I used VBA
          scripts to automate the routine information processing.
