                        At the start of my Summer 2020 internship at <a href="https://career.seagroup.com/" target="_blank">Labs@SEA</a>, I was tasked with implementing a simple gif fetch webapp using Javascript libraries. This personal project served to familiarise me with ReactJS and hone my front-end development skills. It goes without saying that I put in way more effort on that small app than I did for this static website. Note that the original project specification mandated a Google OAuth feature, which I have kept for sake of completeness. However, there is no server or localstorage to store personal information. You can view the app <a href="https://kxiao.net/giphy-search" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        In June and July 2019, my team of four conducted an interesting theoretical study on FOREX options in a perpetual-time setting. With typical, finite-time American call options, for instance, one will not exercise them early when the prevailing domestic interest rate is positive. But in the FOREX case, a delay in exercising means losing out on the quote currency's interest rate. Suppose further that one is given unlimited time to make up his mind. How then to proceed? We determine criteria for optimally exercising perpetual FOREX options - the exercise threshold would be some "stock price" (to be precise, some exchange rate) and the valunder different assumptionsue of the option itself is some function of the underlying price. These would depend only on domestic and foreign interest rate environments and volatility assumptions. Using mathematical reasoning and numerical simulation, we obtained various results which can be seen as generalization of their finite, long-maturity corollaries.

                        Before coming to CMU, I built an Excel Spreadsheet that could provide real-time alerts to price fluctuations, similar to the push notifications that Robinhood sends to your phone. The main difference is that with Robinhood, you see the price movement but you cannot manipulate the data, for instance put it in a chart or record it in a specific table. My spreadsheet uses Excel's <em>Get and Transform</em> Tool (previously known as <em>Power Query</em>) to periodically grab tables of data from a Google Sheet. Upon every refresh, the Google Sheet contained up-to-date information thanks to Google Finance. Lastly, I used VBA scripts to automate the routine information processing.
