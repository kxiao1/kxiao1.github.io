Personal website/ portfolio developed with HTML/ CSS/ Vanilla Javascript and some Bootstrap formatting.

To keep the website simple I have avoided the use of the popular [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) library, even though I am proficient in it. See some of my [other repos](https://github.com/kxiao1?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript&sort=) for sample React projects.

You can access the website at https://kxiao.net.
